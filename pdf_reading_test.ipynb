September 19, 2019)  Heterotropic allosteric activation of protein function, in which binding of one ligand thermodynamically activates the binding of another, different ligand or substrate, is a fundamental control mechanism in metabolism and as such has been a long-aspired capability in protein design', ' Here we show that greatly increasing the magnitude of a protein’s net charge using surface supercharging transforms that protein into an allosteric ligand- and counterion-gated conformational molecular switch', ' To demonstrate this we first modi- fied the designed helical bundle hemoprotein H4, creating a highly charged protein which both unfolds reversibly at low ionic strength and undergoes the ligand-induced folding transition commonly ob- served in signal transduction by intrinsically disordered proteins in biology', ' As a result of the high surface-charge density, ligand binding to this protein is allosterically activated up to 1,300-fold by low con- centrations of divalent cations and the polyamine spermine', ' To extend this process further using a natural protein, we similarly modified Escherichia coli cytochrome b562 and the resulting protein behaves in a like manner', ' These simple model systems not only establish a set of general engineering principles which can be used to convert natural and designed soluble proteins into allosteric molecular switches useful in biodesign, sensing, and synthetic biology, the behavior we have demonstrated––functional activation of supercharged intrinsically dis- ordered proteins by low concentrations of multivalent ions––may be a control mechanism utilized by Nature which has yet to be appreciated', ' intrinsically disordered proteins | supercharging | allostery | ligand-induced folding | protein design Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in nature commonly  function by making a structural change from an unfolded, disordered state to a folded, functional state in response to binding another protein or small molecule or as a result of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (1)', ' This process, in which the binding of another molecule to an IDP induces a phase change to an active structure, is termed “ligand-induced folding” and is a form of heterotropic allosteric activation now known to be prevalent in natural IDPs (2)', '  The hallmarks of IDP structure are a high net charge per residue (3), a relatively low core protein-folding energy (4), and low sequence diversity (5)', ' IDPs are found in almost every functional signal transduction pathway in biology, including cell cycling (6), circadian rhythms (6), posttranscriptional regulation (7), and protein degradation (8)', ' This universality points to the utility of the phase change in regulation: as form equals function in much of molecular biology, having the ability to turn form itself, and therefore function, on and off is a simple and attrac- tive method to control individual nodes in complex interaction networks', ' The ability to design switchable IDPs, both by modi- fying extant natural proteins and by fully de novo IDP design, is critical to the success of future complex network creation efforts in synthetic biology', '  Here we demonstrate that the modification of a protein’s sur- face to greatly increase the magnitude of its net charge imparts the  Y G O L O I B  L A N O I T A T U P M O C  D N A  S C I S Y H P O I B  ligand-induced folding behavior found in natural IDPs', ' Further, the high negative charge density imparts heterotropic allosteric ligand binding behavior in response to divalent cation and polyamino compound effector molecules––specific ion interactions that have not yet been observed in high net-charge natural IDPs', ' Heterotropic allostery is a long-discussed goal in protein design (9)', ' This work thus presents a roadmap for the refashioning of natural and designed globular proteins into allosteric molecular switches which will prove useful in the design of control mechanisms in natural and designed metabolic networks and in the fashioning of improved biosensors', '  Results H4 Protein Redesign', ' The starting point is the designed single-chain diheme tetrahelical bundle protein H4, which is a single-chain variant of the homodimeric protein HP-7 (10, 11)', ' Apo-H4 has a surplus of negatively charged residues––16 more acidic than basic residues (Fig', ' 1A)', ' Because of this, the apoprotein partially unfolds at low ionic strength (SI Appendix, Fig', ' S1)', ' We set out to amplify this property by increasing the net charge', ' The software package ProtCAD (12) was used to create a structural model for holo-H4, and every fully surface-exposed sidechain was changed to glutamic acid, creating an H4 variant termed H4(-52) with 52 excess neg- atively charged sidechains', ' H4 also contains low helical-propensity aspartate and asparagine sidechains that were originally added to increase chemical shift dispersion (13), and these were reverted to  Significance  We present a general method to imbue proteins with hetero- tropic allostery by using surface protein supercharging to impart intrinsic disorder to the protein fold, allowing for functional ac- tivation by low concentrations of multivalent ions, including Mg(II), Ca(II), and spermine', ' We have designed two different proteins which exhibit this property and present a protocol which anyone can employ to impart this property to their pro- tein of interest', ' This method promises to enable future synthetic biology projects which utilize natural fluxes of these ions to di- rectly actuate function at significantly faster rates than that of genetic activation', ' Such multivalent ionic activation of disor- dered proteins may be a mechanism utilized by Nature which has yet to be appreciated', '  Author contributions: P', 'J', 'S', ', J', 'M', 'B', ', B', 'H', 'E', ', C', 'A', 'F', ', and R', 'L', 'K', ' designed research; P', 'J', 'S', ', J', 'M', 'B', ', C',

the same slope within error as that of charge-screening stabilization by NaCl', ' Cation binding in the first phase is strongly supported by the Debye length analysis of the energetic response: when the folding energy at a series of low cation concentrations is plotted against the Debye length of each solution (Fig', ' 5C), each multivalent ion has a linear response that significantly differs from that of NaCl, and indeed different from each other', ' Stabilization by Debye screening alone would result in plots that are superimposable', ' b562(-22) has a similarly exaggerated response to multivalent cations (Fig', ' 5D), demonstrating that this property can also be imparted to natural proteins', '  Allosteric Activation of Cofactor Binding by Multivalent Cations', ' Multivalent cation binding to H4(-28) allosterically activates IHP binding by lowering the thermodynamically coupled folding energy barrier', ' Fig', ' 5E depicts the circular dichroism spectra of the protein both in the presence of moderate concentrations of multivalent cations, insufficient to effect detectable folding of apo-H4(-28), and at relatively high concentrations of those same cations, those suf- ficient to shift the equilibrium fully to the molten globular state', ' Fig', ' 5F depicts the significant increase in cofactor binding affinity, as much as 36-fold, produced by the introduction of
